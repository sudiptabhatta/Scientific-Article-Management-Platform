# Proposal for Article Management Platform Development

### Project Name: Scientific Article Management Platform


***Brief description of the project:***<br/>
This project is about a website that will be used to review scientific articles written by researchers using this as an open review platform. This is a pet project. In this project, I am going to build a website. On this website, I am setting up a sign up program and a login program.

In the sign up section, there will be a field where researchers have to give their username, email, specialization and password and reenter their password to confirm and proceed to account creation. But if he/she already a member, there will be a login section where he/she can log in using their previously registered email and password.

There will be Moderator types on this website. The moderator can approve or delete the posted articles. They have the administrative privilege to monitor the post, which will be published on the website. They have the permission to review an article and then decide if they want to publish it on the website or reject it to publish.

After logging in, there will be a dashboard for every researcher to see their own articles including their username, email and profile picture. If they want to update or delete the article, they can go to their dashboard and edit, update or delete at their own will. They can also update their username, email and profile picture. 

If anyone wants to review an article or read the article, they can click on any article they like, then read it, comment on it, and show their preference in the article. 

There will also be a search option. After clicking it, suggested articles of specialized categories of any researcher will be popped up there, and the researcher can also search for any articles and read them.

Above all these, if possible, I am planning to show some statistics by GROUP BY according to the article category for the benefit of the researcher.
